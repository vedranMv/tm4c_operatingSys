 *
 *  Event logger singleton is thought of as a mechanism to report status from
 *  tasks executed by a task scheduler. Because the idea with tasks scheduler is
 *  that tasks get scheduled in advanced and the issuer of the task doesn't
 *  wait until the task is completed, there is generally no way of telling how
 *  did the task perform. Event logger then provides a way of reporting the
 *  execution outcome by collecting system-wide events into a single linked list,
 *  noting which module emitted the event, at what time and during execution of
 *  which task. Event log is deleted after reaching certain size but most
 *  important information(highest-priority event since startup, last emitted
 *  event and appearance of priority inversion) about events from each module
 *  get remembered even after dropping the log.
 *
 *  @version 1.2.1
 *  V1.0.0 - 2.7.2017
 *  +Support 6 events that can be emitted by different libraries
 *  +Integrated with task scheduler for remote emptying of log
 *  V1.1.0 - 6.7.2017
 *  +Keep track of highest-importance event from startup event of each module
 *  +Prevent spamming of events by logging same, consecutive events only after
 *  a fixed period of time has passed. (only for same, consecutive events
 *  within the same library; taskID doesn't matter)
 *  +Event log can exclusively emit priority-inversion event when module
 *  emits low-priority event after a higher-priority event has already been
 *  logged since last start-up event. Reemitting startup event clears any
 *  previous event of higher priority
 *  +Fixed log length. Log is dropped when limit is reached (last event from
 *  each module is saved, together with priority inversion occurrence and highest
 *  priority event since startup in each module)
 *  V1.1.1 - 9.7.2017
 *  +Added more tasks accessible from task scheduler
 *  +Exposed arrays with last logged event, highest prio. event and prio. inversion
 *  through EventLog member functions
 *  +Added 'Reboot' task to completely clear event logger through task scheduler
 *  V1.2.1 - 2.9.2017
 *  +Added interface for soft-reboot of kernel module
 *  +Moved soft reboot of all other modules to event logger kernel callback
